Take 10 minutes to think about API endpoints that youâ€™ve used before. How were they structured? Did you have to use different HTTP methods? Write down some URLs that you had to use to make API requests.

**They were structure with a static host name, but they would have different paths depending on the type of information you were either trying to GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH and so on. The path would also change depending on the information you wanted to fetch, for example USERS, or MOVIES, or ORDERS they would have different paths.**

**Something like this for example:**
**- www.turing.io/api/v2/users/{some id}**
